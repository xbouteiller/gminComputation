## Program flow


#### Step 1
1. The program ask to chose:
    - A folder that will be parsed 
    - Some unique ID from a single file

The program writes the number of files found

#### Step 2
2. You have to chose which method you will use:
    - Select time interval manually then compute gmin in the interval time
    - Filtering the data based on RWC and then compute gmin in the interval time

#### Step 3 - Option 1
3. If you chose the manual points selection:
    - You have to select two points on the curve
    - Gmin is computed based on a linear regression between these two points

#### Step 3 - Option 2
4. If you chose the method based on RWC:
    - the semi auto method will plot curve each time
    - the full auto will precede to the gmin computation automatically


5. The data are first filtered based on RWC:

Default values for the RWC filtering are 80% and 50%, but thsi can be changed manually:
>
> python gminExec.py --rwc_sup 90 --rwc_inf 20 # Superior threshold : 90%, inferior : 20%  
> 
> python gminExec.py -rs 90 -ri 20 # It is a shortcut for the code above
>

6. Gmin is computed based on a linear regression between the two boundaries of the RWC filtered data

#### Step 5
7. Synthetic figures and data frames are saved within the output_fig and output_files folder

## Data format

Data must be stored within files
For a better files recognition, first row of the csv file should contain the string "conductance" otherwise all csv from a folder will be parsed

Columns should be named as follows:


#### Quantitative columns

- weight_g : leaf weight as a function of time (g)
- T_C : temperature (Â°C)
- RH : Relative Humidity
- Patm : atmospheric pressure (KPa)
- Area_m2 : area of the leaf (m2)

#### Qualitative columns

- campaign : campaign name
- sample_ID : ID of the sample, should be unique for each sample

#### Date

- date_time : time **(best with the format YEAR/MONTH/DAY HOUR:MINUTE )**
